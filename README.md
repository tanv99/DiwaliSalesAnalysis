# Diwali Sales Analysis

## Problem Statement

Analyze Diwali sales data to enhance both customer satisfaction and sales performance.

## Research Questions

1. What is the gender distribution among Diwali buyers, and how does it impact their purchasing behavior?
2. How does age influence product preferences and buying patterns during Diwali sales?
3. Which states show the highest sales and order volumes during Diwali, and what factors contribute to this?
4. What is the purchasing power and behavior of married women during Diwali, and how does it differ from other demographic groups?
5. In which occupational sectors do Diwali buyers predominantly work, and how does their occupation impact their buying choices?
6. What are the most popular product categories during Diwali sales, and how do they vary across different demographics?

## Hypothesis

The hypothesis suggests that obtaining insights into the diverse demographics of Diwali buyers, including individuals across different age ranges employed in various sectors and residing in different regions, can reveal discernible patterns. Leveraging these patterns could enable the refinement of marketing strategies and product offerings, ultimately aiming to enhance customer experience and boost sales during the festive Diwali season.


## Technologies and Tools Used

1. Python: Utilized for scripting and data analysis.
2. Pandas: Employed for data manipulation and analysis.
3. NumPy: Used for numerical operations and array manipulations.
4. Matplotlib: Utilized for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
5. Seaborn:Used for statistical data visualization and enhancing the aesthetics of Matplotlib plots.
6. Jupyter Notebook:Used as the interactive computing environment for running Python scripts and visualizing data.

## Key Concepts Used

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Removed unnecessary columns (e.g., 'Status', 'unnamed1').Handled missing values using dropna().
2. Data Visualization: Employed various types of charts, such as count plots, bar plots, and stacked bar plots, to visualize different aspects of sales data.
3. Descriptive Statistics: Used describe() to obtain summary statistics for numeric columns.
4. Grouping and Aggregation: Utilized groupby() to group data based on specific columns and performed aggregations, such as sum and sorting.
5. Labeling and Annotations: Applied labels to bar plots for enhanced data interpretation.
6. Customizing Plots: Adjusted the size of plots and customized plot aesthetics using Seaborn and Matplotlib settings.
